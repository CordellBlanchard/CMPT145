Problem #1:
Swap players was not swapping the letters because characters are immutable  
Solution: must return the swapped player and assign player to the new returned value.
Problem #2
in random_filled was not assigning the players move to any spot in the columns
solution: on line 43 instead of assigning col = col + [player] i changed it to
board[col_choice] = col + [player]
Problem #3
in random_filled it was not assiging the '.' to the board
solution: used append since that changes a current list instead of making a new one
Problem #4
gloabl variables for height that did not to be there.
solution: deleted them
