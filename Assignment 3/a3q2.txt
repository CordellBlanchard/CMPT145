problem #1: 
on line 136 was concetenating a list with a string 
solution: changed line[v] to [line[v]]

problem #2:
added new argument j to extract_4_from_row and extract_4_from_column to
add robustness so that if you wanted to use function outside of main file you
could choose any point in board you want to extract 4 from.
Works fine in main file and test script.

problem #3
not all 'No decision' strings were consistent some had 'No decision ' and 'No  Decision'
solution: made all strings with the sentence No decision = 'No decision'

problem #4
function check_4diags did not take an input square so it did not affect
the square on line 101
solution: added a parameter for square

problem #5
check_1x4 was using is as comparison instead of == which is incorrect because
we want to compare values not references same thing occured in check_4diags.
soltuion: changed all is to == in check_1x4

problem #6
diagdn was not correct in check_4diags was ouputting diagup in opposite direction
solution: changed square[3-j][3-j] to square[3-j][j] on line 45

problem #7
on line 99 and 81 there was height-4 and width-4 but they must both be
subtracted by 3 so the last row or diagonal doesnt get left out.

problem #8
added board to check_board as a parameter so that I could use it for test
script works in main file without.
